### Phase 2-pre — Project planning & data scoping — 2026-04-25

**Decided:**
- v2 builds **on top of** v1's FastAPI + frontend + Claude agent infrastructure, not in place of it. v1 docs and code stay untouched.
- All v2 planning docs prefixed `PHASE2_`. v1 docs (no prefix) are untouched.
- **Spatial unit: county-level training, state-level reporting** via planted-acres-weighted aggregation. ~80× more training rows than state-only.
- **Forecast dates locked at Aug 1 / Sep 1 / Oct 1 / End-of-Season** per brief.
- **Five states locked at IA / CO / WI / MO / NE** per brief.
- **Foundation model is Prithvi**, integration mode default = frozen feature extractor (Phase D.1). End-to-end fine-tune (D.2) is a stretch goal contingent on D.1 ablation showing lift.
- **Cone of uncertainty methodology = analog-year retrieval** (K-nearest neighbors over a feature embedding, percentile band over observed yields of analog (county, year, date) tuples). NOT quantile regression, NOT Bayesian credible intervals. Brief explicitly defines it this way.
- **Point estimate model = XGBoost (or LightGBM) on engineered features** as the v2 baseline; Prithvi features layered in as ablation.
- **Initial training data depth: 2005–2024.** 2024 reserved as holdout, 2023 reserved as validation. *(Note: this was reverted to 2015–2024 mid-day in the merge of the existing data state, then reverted back to 2005–2024 — see Phase 2-pre-revision below.)*
- **Feature/label "as-of" rule:** when constructing features for forecast date D in year Y, only data with timestamps strictly before D is allowed. Enforced in `forecast/features.py` (to be written).
- **Repo organization:** v2 code under new `forecast/` package + `scripts/forecast_*.py` for one-offs + `frontend/forecast/` for new UI pieces. v1 packages (`backend/`, `agent/`, `frontend/index.html`+`app.js`) gain new files but don't have existing files modified.
- **Phase plan defines 7 phases (A–G)** with explicit go/no-go gates at end of B, C, D.

**Rejected alternatives:**
- **State-level training only.** ~5 rows per year × 20 years = 100 rows total. Too small for meaningful ML.
- **Quantile regression / NGBoost / Bayesian deep learning for the cone.** Could give calibrated cones, but cones aren't interpretable and don't match the brief's literal definition. Analog retrieval is the brief's specified methodology.
- **Skip Prithvi, use only XGBoost.** Defensible but undersells the brief, which names Prithvi explicitly. At minimum Phase D.1 (frozen Prithvi as feature extractor) is in scope.
- **Prithvi end-to-end fine-tune as default.** High effort, uncertain lift, blocks shipping a complete pipeline. D.2 is conditional on D.1 results.
- **Use the v1 SegFormer model for corn-pixel masking.** CDL is purpose-built for this (USDA's own corn mask) and free.
- **Use NDVI alone instead of HLS for Prithvi.** NDVI is a derived index; Prithvi was pretrained on raw HLS. NDVI stays as a feature, HLS is the imagery layer for D.1.
- **Use the user's existing monthly mean temp/precip for GDD computation.** Monthly means lose the daily heat-stress signal that yield models need. Daily PRISM/gridMET is required; the monthly data stays as a coarse smoothed feature.
- **Treat tornado activity as a feature.** Tornado damage is highly localized; aggregated to county-year has near-zero signal. Deprioritized.
- **Carry pixel-level gSSURGO into the model.** Soil features are static across years, so pixel-level only explains between-county variance. Aggregate to county-level features early.

**Surprises / learnings:**
- The user's data inventory was very strong on the tabular/ground-truth side (NASS, water-applied, gSSURGO) and missing the satellite-imagery-as-feature side (no HLS, no CDL standalone, no Prithvi). The brief's centerpiece (foundation-model features over multispectral imagery) is exactly the part that needs the most acquisition work in Phase A / D.1.
- **NDVI vs. HLS** is a common point of confusion. They aren't substitutes — NDVI is derived from HLS bands, and Prithvi expects the raw bands. The user's GEE NDVI download is useful as a smoothed feature but does not eliminate the need for HLS in Phase D.1.
- **CDL** is needed for masking; for now it's used inside the Earth Engine NDVI script (`cropland == 1`). A standalone local download will be needed if HLS pulling for Phase D.1 happens.

**Open questions carried forward:**
- HLS storage strategy — TB-scale. Settle in Phase D.1 opening.
- HLS coverage for 2005–2013 (Landsat-only era) is sparser than 2015+. Document caveat in Phase D.1.
- Final feature set for the *retrieval embedding* (vs. covariates) — Phase B.1.
- K for K-NN analog retrieval — default 10, tune in Phase B.5.
- Cone percentiles to publish in the API — default {10, 50, 90}.
- Whether to ship Phase D.2 (Prithvi fine-tune) — conditional on D.1 ablation.
- PRISM vs. gridMET for daily weather — decide when `prism_pull.py` is written.
- Drought source — US Drought Monitor vs. SPI/SPEI from PRISM — Phase A.4/A.5.
- County coverage filter (minimum N years per county) — decide after full 2005–2024 NASS extension.

### Phase 2-pre-revision — Date range and existing-pipeline reconciliation — 2026-04-25

**Context:** the user shared the actual current state of their data pipeline mid-planning. Two reconciliation decisions resulted, plus a date-range correction.

**Decided:**
- **Time range stays at 2005–2024** per the brief's explicit "Data spans from 2005-2024" instruction. The merged-doc draft briefly used 2015–2024 to match the existing NASS pull, but the brief specifies 2005, and using only half the available history weakens analog-year retrieval (10 candidate years per query becomes ~17–18). User has agreed to extend the NASS pull and the GEE NDVI export to cover 2005–2014.
- **Adopted the user's pipeline architecture** as the canonical Phase A structure. Specifically: separate `*_pull.py` and `*_features.py` per source, then `merge_all.py` for the final join. This pattern is already followed by `nass_pull.py` and is now baked into the Phase A sub-phase deliverables.
- **MODIS NDVI (via Earth Engine, server-side, corn-masked via CDL) is the primary remote-sensing feature for Phases B and C.** Raw HLS is deferred to Phase D.1 (Prithvi). The two are explicitly complementary, not substitutes — MODIS gives smoothed seasonal indices at county-year granularity; HLS gives raw multispectral chips for Prithvi to encode.
- **PRISM (or gridMET) is the daily weather source.** Both work; PRISM is US-focused. Final pick deferred until `prism_pull.py` is written.
- **Train/val/holdout split scaled to the longer history:** train = 2005–2022 (18 years), val = 2023, holdout = 2024.
- **gSSURGO Valu1 table** is the canonical source for soil features, aggregated to county via zonal stats over TIGER/Line 2018 polygons. Reproject before zonal stats (gSSURGO is EPSG:5070 Albers).
- **Combined-practice yield (`yield_bu_acre_all`) is the target.** 100% coverage in the current NASS pull. Irrigation effect captured via `irrigated_share` derived feature where data exists.
- **Preserved the user's data-quality fixes already applied to `nass_pull.py`:** pin `prodn_practice_desc` (avoids 81-row fan-out), filter "OTHER (COMBINED) COUNTIES" placeholder rows, strip commas before `pd.to_numeric`. These are now documented in `PHASE2_DATA_INVENTORY.md` and `PHASE2_CURRENT_STATE.md`.
- **Preserved the user's deprioritization decisions:** hourly weather, day length / sunrise-sunset, CO₂ as a per-county feature. Documented with rationale.
- **Preserved the user's GEE bug fixes:** use `ee.ImageCollection('USDA/NASS/CDL').filter(...)` instead of string-concatenating `ee.Number` into asset paths; wrap demo image to reset accumulated `system:description` metadata.

**Rejected alternatives:**
- **Cutting time range to 2015–2024** — would reduce analog-year candidate pool by ~50% and contradict the brief's explicit "2005-2024" instruction. Rejected.
- **Holding 2023+2024 as a 2-year holdout** — clean validation discipline (separate val and holdout) is more portfolio-defensible. Rejected in favor of train 2005–2022 / val 2023 / holdout 2024.
- **Re-running NASS pull immediately to fill non-irrigated columns** — non-irrigated is derivable as `acres_harvested_all − acres_harvested_irr` for the 4 fields that have irrigated data. Re-run is optional, low priority. The historical-extension re-run (to add 2005–2014) is higher priority.

**Surprises / learnings:**
- The user's `nass_pull.py` already encodes three subtle NASS-API gotchas (multi-practice fan-out, OTHER-COUNTIES placeholders, comma-separated numeric strings). These would have cost ~half a day to rediscover; preserving them in the docs is worth more than re-deriving them.
- The user's GEE script is more complete than the planning docs assumed — it already does corn-masking via CDL and county-level reduction server-side. The output CSV is already at `(GEOID, year)` granularity, which simplifies `merge_all.py` substantially (no local zonal stats needed for NDVI).
- The Earth Engine `ee.Number` JS-concat bug is a real footgun and worth keeping documented for any future GEE work in this repo.

**Open questions carried forward:**
- Can the existing GEE export be re-run for 2005–2014 in one task, or does it need to be split? (CDL availability per year may force splitting.)
- After the NASS extension to 2005–2014, what's the actual county coverage by year? Some Colorado mountain counties may drop out for additional years; need to QC.

### Phase 2-pre — USDM format chosen — 2026-04-25

**Decided:**
- **US Drought Monitor data acquired in Cumulative Percent Area format.** Each D-level column reports the percentage of the county at that level *or worse* (D0 = abnormally dry+, D1 = moderate+, D2 = severe+, D3 = extreme+, D4 = exceptional). Weekly granularity (USDM publishes Thursdays). 5 states, 2005–2024, county level.
- **Categorical splits derivable post-hoc** as `cat_D{n} = cum_D{n} − cum_D{n+1}`. Cumulative is strictly more flexible — no information loss vs. picking categorical at acquisition time.
- **Drought Severity Coverage Index (DSCI)** = sum of cumulative D0–D4 columns (range 0–500). Single scalar capturing "how bad and how widespread." Strong candidate for the analog-year retrieval embedding.
- **As-of join rule for forecast features:** USDM week-ending dates are Thursdays. When joining to a forecast date D, use the most recent USDM Thursday strictly *before* D (not ≤). Prevents same-week leakage.

**Rejected alternatives:**
- **Population-weighted variants** (Cumulative/Categorical Population, Cumulative/Categorical Population Percent). Population-weighted drought is useful for water-management policy; corn fields don't care about people. Rejected.
- **Categorical Percent Area** at acquisition. Equivalent information content but less flexible — would have to roll back up to cumulative for severity-ladder features. Rejected; cumulative covers both use cases.
- **Raw area (square miles)** rather than percent. Would let county-size differences dominate the signal. Percent is comparable across counties of any size. Rejected.
- **SPI/SPEI from PRISM as the sole drought source.** Derivable but redundant with USDM, which is the agronomic standard and is already gathered. Keep PRISM-derived indices available as a fallback feature only.

**Surprises / learnings:**
- USDM exports include both cumulative and categorical in separate files; cumulative was the right pick because every published agronomic drought feature (DSCI, drought-week counts, peak-during-silking) is built from cumulative. Categorical is a derived view, not a primary source.

**Open questions carried forward:**
- Exact column names in the downloaded CSV — spot-check after acquisition. Common conventions: `D0/D1/D2/D3/D4` directly, or `pct_D0/...`, or full names like `Drought_D0`. Document in `drought_features.py`.
